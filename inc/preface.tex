\chapter*{Preface}
This project thesis is meant as preparation for a master thesis in marine structural engineering at Department of Marine Technology at NTNU. The work of the project thesis was carried out in the fall of 2018. \newline
\newline
The topic for the master thesis is fatigue of dynamic power cable applied in offshore wind farms. This topic was chosen due to the author's interest for fatigue, a well as the opportunity to use well-known methods and software from the oil and gas industry with new and upcoming renewable technology. This project thesis contains a comprehensive literature study and theory about offshore wind, dynamic power cables, and fatigue. It also includes a description of the creation of two different numeric models that will be used in the master thesis to estimate the lifetime of the cable for the chosen location. The numeric background for the software that will be used in the master thesis is also included. \newline
\newline
All the work have been executed by the author of the project thesis, Karoline Bakken.
