abstract = {In the past few decades, growth in the wind energy sector has been most phenomenal among all renewable energy resources. And, in this context, it is nearly universally agreed that wind energy can definitely play an important part in ensuring a sustainable future. The present book was written to address the needs of those readers interested in wind energy converters. The authors have tried to strike a balance between a short book chapter and a very detailed book for experts in the field. There were three prime reasons behind doing so: first, the field is highly interdisciplinary and requires a more accessible format for non-experts. The second reason for this more compact version is that both authors have encountered many students and technically oriented people who were searching for this type of book on wind energy. The third reason and motivation for writing this book was to provide some initial information to people who are embarking on a career in the wind industry. It is this group of people that the present book is targeted at.},

abstract = {•Coupled response analysis is performed to study the energy performance of wave energy converter system and the fatigue life of the mooring lines and power cable.•The presence of biofouling reduces the power absorption of wave energy converter.•The presence of biofouling reduces the fatigue life of mooring lines.•Inline wave and current load on a mooring or cable causes significant decrease in fatigue lives. This study presents an analysis of a wave energy converter (WEC) system consisting of a buoy, a mooring system, and a power cable connected to a hub. The investigated WEC system is currently under full-scale testing near Runde in Norway. The purpose of the study was to investigate the characteristics of the entire system, primarily with regard to energy performance and the fatigue life of the mooring lines and power cable, considering the effects of marine biofouling and its growth on the system’s components. By means of parametric study, the energy performance and fatigue life of the mooring lines and power cable were investigated considering two mooring configurations, three biofouling conditions, four sea states in a scatter diagram, and three wave and current directions. Hydrodynamic and structural response simulations were conducted in a coupled response analysis using the DNV-GL software SESAM. Energy performance analyses and stress-based rainflow counting fatigue calculations were performed separately using an in-house code. The results show that, for a WEC system which has been deployed for 25 years, biofouling can reduce the total power absorption by up to 10% and decrease the fatigue life of the mooring lines by approximately 20%.},

abstract = {<p> Reliable marine power cables are imperative for the cost-effective operation of marine energy conversion systems. There is considerable experience with marine power cables under static and dynamic load conditions but the loading regimes for floating marine energy converters are not well understood, due to a lack of field experience. This paper aims to assess mechanical load conditions and failure modes for a dynamic power cable that is connected to a floating wave energy converter. The applied approach combines experimental tank test data with numerical modelling and site-specific wave characteristics to identify maximum load points and to quantify the fatigue life. The effect of varying wave parameters on maximum loads and fatigue cycles is investigated and results are presented for two common umbilical configurations: catenary and lazy wave. In situations with limited field experience, the presented approach provides a tool to determine if critical components are fit for purpose and to assess the expected level of reliability prior to deployment. The cable conductor’s fatigue life is estimated for the lazy wave configuration and highlights component fatigue failure as a major concern that must be addressed in floating marine energy applications. </p>},

@book{Hills1994,
series = {Solid Mechanics and Its Applications},
abstract = {Failures of many mechanical components in service result from fatigue. The cracks which grow may either originate from some pre-existing macroscopic defect, or, if the component is of high integrity but highly stressed, a region of localized stress concentration. In turn, such concentrators may be caused by some minute defect, such as a tiny inclusion, or inadvertent machining damage. Another source of surface damage which may exist between notionally 'bonded' components is associated with minute relative motion along the interface, brought about usually be cyclic tangential loading. Such fretting damage is quite insidious, and may lead to many kinds of problems such as wear, but it is its influence on the promotion of embryo cracks with which we are concerned here. When the presence of fretting is associated with decreased fatigue performance the effect is known as fretting fatigue. Fretting fatigue is a subject drawing equally on materials science and applied mechanics, but it is the intention in this book to concentrate attention entirely on the latter aspects, in a search for the quantification of the influence of fretting on both crack nucleation and propagation. There have been very few previous texts in this area, and the present volume seeks to cover five principal areas; (a) The modelling of contact problems including partial slip under tangentialloading, which produces the surface damage. (b) The modelling of short cracks by rigorous methods which deal effectively with steep stress gradients, kinking and closure. (c) The experimental simulation of fretting fatigue.},

abstract = {Submarine power cables are widely used for local and national distribution and it is of interest to know their mechanical limitations particularly with regard to the loads experienced during the installation process where static or low-cycle fatigue failures are possible. A detailed understanding of the global and internal mechanics of such cables is therefore of interest in order to achieve the required performance at reasonable weight. This paper addresses the relationship between applied loads and the responses of the metallic elements within typical subsea configurations. The existing theory on mechanics of cables of this type is extended to take into account strain distributions within helical elements and to model the interactions between loading modes as well as including nonlinear effects associated with plasticity in the metallic elements and compliance of the polymeric material within the composite construction. The results of a number of material tests are incorporated into the new analysis and the predictions of the model are also compared with measurements on the conductors of cables under conditions of axial and bending loading.},
